# DiscordOwOBot
This is a little joke bot that I made.
Since this is the first Discord bot I ever made, It doesn't work how you would normally expect one to work. After inviting the bot to the server, only I had control over when it activated or not because I didn't know how to allow server moderators to use chat commands with the bot. After working with Word-Tracker for so long I have since learned this. 
This bot is very interesting as when activated it will take a message sent by a user, delete their message, change their message into OwO speak, prepend their name on the front of the message and then resend it.
